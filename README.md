# About
Javascript SDK for api.six.se
<!-- TODO: add Contact info -->

## Usage

```javascript
// for testing you can get token with:
// Six._internal.authenticateWithCredentials(client_id,client_secreat)
var TOKEN = 'token-authenticated-in-backend'

/* Six.connect(TOKEN,[endpoint]) */
var session = Six.connect(TOKEN)

/* session.subscribe(resource,callbackFn(error,data)) */
var unsubscribe = session.subscribe('/listings/848',function(err,data) {
  console.log('data',data,err)
})
```

## Getting started
## Installing from NPM
Install ```six-sdk``` in project
```bash
# npm install six-sdk
```

Require the module as usual:

```javascript
var Six = require('six-sdk')
var session = Six.connect('token-from-backend')
```

## Installing from CDN
```html
<html>
  <body>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.six.se/js/six-sdk/0/six-sdk.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      // the SDK is installed as 'Six' in the global scope
      var session = Six.connect('token-from-backend')
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Global scope

When using the SDK from *cdn.six.se* the SDK is installed as ```Six``` in the global scope. If there is a risk that this name will clash with some other var, you can change the name of the global by setting ```SIX_GLOBAL_NAMESPACE``` **before loading the SDK**:

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      // install the SDK as VendorSix
      window.SIX_GLOBAL_NAMESPACE = 'VendorSix'
    </script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://cdn.six.se/js/six-sdk/0/six-sdk.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      var session = VendorSix.connect('token-from-backend')
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## API
Before using the any of the methods in the SDK you must retrieve an authentication token from api.six.se (see the documentation for the API). This is usually done in some backend system and provided as an global var in the HTML document returned to the browser.

## Session

All methods to retrive data from the API is attached to the Session object.

- subscribe(resource,callback(error,data,unsubsribe)) -> unsubscribeFn
- refresh(resource)
- create(resource,data) -> Promise
- update(resource,data) -> Promise
- remove(resource) -> Promise
- clearCache()
- onError(callback(error))
- onSessionExpired(callback())
- setToken()


### Create a session

To create a new session object:

```javascript
var session = Six.connect(TOKEN)
```

Some of the functionality and analytics in the API requires some additional context (ie userid, entitlement groups etc).

To create a session with additional context:

```javascript
var session = Six.connect(TOKEN).withContext({userId: '16ef65e39e6114fa6d9510042ad83472c9db756a'})
```

For more information about session contexts, see the API documentation.

### Getting data from the API

The primary way to retrive data from api is via ```subscribe(resource,callbackFn)```

The ```subscribe``` method takes a resource (relative to the API endpoint, ie ```/markets/SEE``` not ```https://api.six.se/v2/markets/SSE```) and a callback function.

The callback function will be called anytime there is new data available for the resource from the SDK (some other component have called ```refresh``` etc). The callback *may* be called **more than once**.

The callback can also first be called with an error object, and later with data.

The callback will be called with the arguments:
- **error** is provided if the request for data couldn't be fullfilled (see section on errors below)
- **data** the data provided by the api
- **unsubscribeFn** a function that, when called, unsubscribes the callback from future updates

**unsubscribeFn** is also returned from the ```subscribe``` call itself

```javascript
// retrive the reference data for an listing with id 848
var unsubscribeFn = session.subscribe('/listings/848',function(error,listing, unsubscribeFn) {
  //  this callback can be called more then once  
})
```

#### Error objects
Errors returned from the SDK methods is of the same structure as error responses from the API.

```javascript
{
  code: "AJAX_ERROR",
  title: "Request to endpoint failed",
  description: "The request failed. Check that the endpoint is valid?",
  details: {
    endpoint: 'https://api.six.se/v2/'
  }
}
```

#### onError
All errors are sent to the onError function

```javascript
// register an error handler with the session
session.onError(function logErrors (error) {
  // this callback can be called more then once
})
```

#### onSessionExpired and setToken
When the API indicates that the token has expired onSessionExpired callback will be called.
There are two ways of setting a new token.

**Return the new token in the onSessionExpired callback**
```javascript
session.onSessionExpired(function refreshToken() {
  // This callback will be called for every request that receives session expired
  return fetchNewToken()
})
```

**Set the new token with setToken()**
```javascript
session.onSessionExpired(function refreshToken() {
  // This callback will be called for every request that receives session expired
  session.setToken(fetchNewToken())
})
```

**Refresh token every hour**
```javascript
// You can set a new token any time
var ONE_HOUR = 1000 * 60 * 60
setInterval(function updateToken() {
  session.setToken(fetchNewToken())
}, ONE_HOUR)
```

### Caching

The SDK caches all resources fetched from the API, and all subscribers for the same resource will receive the same data when new data arrives.This means that multiple components on a page using the same underlying data will be kept in sync.

Data is cached until the session is destroyed (typically the next pageview) or ```session.clearCache()``` is called. 

<!-- TODO: something about entities and matching in populations -->

### Refreshing data

To populate the cache with new data, there is a method ```session.refresh(resource)```. The API will be called and all subscribers for the resource will have their callbacks called.

```javascript
session.refresh('/listings/848')
```
